## CCG Game Server (WIP)

> The actual game does not exist, this project is based on a concept of the essential functionalities of a collectible card game (like MTGA, Heartstone, Legends of Runeterra, etc.).

A lightweight, async game server built in Rust with a custom binary protocol.
Originally designed for a card game that doesnâ€™t exist, this server handles client connections, verifies packets, and broadcasts game state updates with zero fluff and maximum control.

- ðŸ”’ Custom protocol with headers, checksums, and error codes
- ðŸ“¦ Packet parsing and game state broadcasting
- ðŸ“¡ Asynchronous TCP server using tokio
- ðŸ‘¥ Client management with per-connection state
- ðŸ›‘ Error handling and disconnection fallback logic

## ðŸ§ª Status

Still early. Basic client-server handshake is in. <br>
Protocol is defined. Game logic is next.<br>
Nothingâ€™s production-readyâ€”yet.<br>

## ðŸ’€ Disclaimer

This is educational. No encryption, no TLS, no mercy.
Use at your own risk.

## Protocol
``` 
[Protocol Header (Fixed 6 bytes)]
[COBOR-encoded payload]
```
