## Collectible Card Game - TCP Server

> Disclaimer: The actual game does not exist, this project is based on a concept of the essential functionalities of a collectible card game (like MTGA, Heartstone, Legends of Runeterra, etc.).

This server uses a custom protocol created by an inexperienced developer (me) and is not advised to be used in any way that requires a reliable design.
